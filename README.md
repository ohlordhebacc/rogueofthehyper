# HyperRogue

funny fork of the EVIL version of spherical geometry rogue clone "rogue of the hyper" by rogue of the zeno. this might have actual changes (even if just changing numbers around), or it might never be touched again. who knows!!!!!! the rest of the description is just the normal readme.

A puzzle roguelike in the hyperbolic plane. See the [HyperRogue website](http://roguetemple.com/z/hyper.php) for detailed and most up-to-date information.
Compiled executables can be downloaded from [itch.io](https://zenorogue.itch.io/hyperrogue) and from the [HyperRogue website](http://www.roguetemple.com/z/hyper/download.php).

## The game ##
You are a lone outsider in a strange, non-Euclidean world. You can move with the numpad, vi keys (hjklyubn), or mouse. You can also skip turns by pressing ".".

As a Rogue, your goal is to collect as many treasures as possible. However, collecting treasures attracts dangerous monsters (on the other hand, killing the monsters allows more treasures to be generated).

You can kill most monsters by moving into them. Similarly, if the monster was next to you at the end of your turn, it would kill you. The game protects you from getting yourself killed accidentally by ignoring moves which lead to instant death (similar to the check rule from Chess).

Ultimately, you will probably run into a situation where monsters surround you. That means that your adventure is over, and you will have to teleport back to the Euclidean world to survive by pressing Escape (quit).

Collecting enough treasure also allows you to find rare magical orbs, which grant you one-time or time-limited special abilities.

The world is a combination of over 60 types of lands. Each land type has specific style (monsters, treasure, magical orbs, terrain features). Collecting treasures only attracts more monsters in lands of the same type, so you can try to collect lots of treasure in several different lands!

Some of these lands are available from the beginning, others can be found only if you have proven yourself (press ESC to know what you should do to access more lands). Ultimately, you will be able to access Hell, and look for the fabulous Orbs of Yendor which are hidden there. Get at least one of them to prove that you are a true winner! Only the best players will be able to face the challenges of Hell, but both the monsters and the challenges associated with the Orbs of Yendor are different than in the rest of the game, so it should be worth it.

You can see tooltips by placing the mouse over stuff. You can also right click to get more information about game objects.

Press v to configure the game. You can also rotate the world by pressing arrow keys, PageUp and PageDn (not numpad). You can center on the PC by pressing Home.

Your scores and other stats about your games are recorded to file hyperrogue.log (in Linux, *~/.hyperrogue.log*). You can save your configuration to file hyperrogue.ini (in Linux, *~/.hyperrogue.ini*).

The surface the game is played on is called a hyperbolic plane. It seems there is just a very small amount of games and other works of art which use hyperbolic geometry (the most well known are some works of M.C.  Escher).

The game dynamically generates new parts of the world as you move. Due to nature of the hyperbolic plane, the chances that you get back to a place where you have been before are very low (unless you go back exactly the same way). See more information about the geometry used [on the blog](http://zenorogue.blogspot.com/2012/03/hyperbolic-geometry-in-hyperbolic-rogue.html).

You can aim for the Orb of Yendor, or you can simply aim for as high score as possible.

## Modifications

OK, now lots of the above can be changed. You can change the geometry and topology (to Euclidean, spherical, or even to nonisotropic 3D geometries). You can play challenges based on
various in-game quests, and even try some other game genres in non-Euclidean spaces (roguelite aka shmup, racing, peaceful puzzles).

## RogueViz

HyperRogue uses [RogueViz](http://roguetemple.com/z/hyper/rogueviz.php), which is our engine for non-Euclidean games, computations and visualizations. This repo includes the source code of RogueViz demos in subdirectory `rogueviz`, but
not the data, which is available on [itch.io](https://zenorogue.itch.io/rogueviz). RogueViz is funded by the National Science Centre, Poland, grant UMO-2019/35/B/ST6/04456.

## Development ##

### Build prerequisites ###

On Linux with apt-get:

```sudo apt-get install make g++ libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libglew-dev```

On macOS with Homebrew:

```brew install sdl sdl_ttf sdl_gfx sdl_mixer glew libpng```

### Building HyperRogue from source ###
```
git clone https://github.com/zenorogue/hyperrogue.git hyperrogue
cd hyperrogue
HYPERROGUE_USE_GLEW=1 HYPERROGUE_USE_PNG=1 make
```

The `mymake` program builds HyperRogue in parts. It takes longer than the method shown above, but it uses significantly less memory during compilation, and when you change something, `mymake` will only recompile the changed file.
Additionally, it can be easily configured, e.g., to produce an optimized build, or to include addons (see `mymake.cpp` for some example invocations, and `devmods` for some example addons).
Most useful parameters include `-O3` (optimized build), `-rv` (include the RogueViz demos), `-vr` (build the VR version). Compiler flags like `-Werror` (treat warnings as errors) and `-march=native` work too.


```
make mymake && ./mymake
```

The source code is not documented very well. You can see the current state of the documentation, as generated by Doxygen, [here](https://zenorogue.github.io/hyperrogue-doc/).
